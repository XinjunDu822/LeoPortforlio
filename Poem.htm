		  Those of scholars, each one singing his as it should be hopeful and cheerful.<br><br>            
		  The students singing theirs as they pull out their pencils or notebooks.<br><br>                       
		  The teachers singing theirs as they make ready for lesson, or leave off for lessons.<br><br> 
                  The counselors singing what belongs to them in their office, the principal singing on the stage.<br><br>                                                                                                                            		  The band kids singing as they sit on their chairs, the percussionists singing theirs as they stand.<br><br>                                                                                                                      		  The bus drivers’ song, the parents on their way in the morning, or at noon or at the evening activities.<br><br>                                                                                                           		  The beautiful singing of the chorus, or of the young musicians at the school, or of the custodian cleaning.<br><br>

           <h2>An Earth Without Humans</h2>
           <p>
         
              What will an earth look like without humans?<br><br>

		Will it be more beautiful<br><br>
		Like a huge garden?<br><br>
		Will it be more ugly<br><br>
		Without any cities and buildings?<br><br>
		Is it more quiet<br><br>
		Without chatter and laughter?<br><br>
		Or will it be filled with sounds<br><br>
		Of the howling wind and singing birds?<br><br>

		Maybe it will remain the same<br><br>
		As a shiny pearl resting in the vast ocean of the universe.

           <h2>Seem To Be</h2>
           <p>
         
              I seem to be a pig, basking in the sun and relaxing in the mud.<br><br>                                              But really I’m a rabbit, running and jumping endlessly.<br><br>                                                                    
I seem to be a rock, stiff and rigid.<br><br>                                                                                            But really I’m a gust of wind, flowing through the woods and mountains.<br><br>                                                 
I seem to be a winter day, quiet and solemn.<br><br>                                                                                But really I’m a sunny day, passionate and enthusiastic.<br><br>                                                                        I seem to be a piano, calm and graceful.<br><br>                                                                                          But really I’m a saxophone, noisy and cheerful.<br><br>                                                                                     I seem to be an apple, loving and sweet.<br><br>                                                                                       But really I’m a durian, having spikes outside but greatness inside.<br><br>                                                     
I seem to be a GPS, always knowing my directions.<br><br>                                                                         
But really I’m a boat in the darkness, never knowing what will happen next.

            <h2>Arrival</h2>
            <p>

Mom, Dad,<br><br>    
Are we there yet?<br><br>   
I know I already asked this before,<br><br>   
But are we in America yet?<br><br><br>     

The answer was no,<br><br>    
I had to suffer more.<br><br>   
And I knew the truth<br><br>   
That I couldn’t take this anymore.<br><br><br>

This place is like hell,<br><br>   
Filled with weird smells.<br><br>   
I turned up the screen,<br><br>   
Doing my hourly routine.<br><br><br> 

Movies after movies,<br><br>   
Shows after shows.<br><br>   
I began to lose my temper,<br><br>   
But I couldn’t let it show.<br><br><br>   

After several hours,<br><br>   
The plane stopped flying.<br><br>   
We arrived in America,<br><br>   
With the hope of a better living.

            <h2>I Am Hopeful Because I Am Young</h2>
            <p>

I am hopeful because I am young, like a dandelion seed, carried by the wind into the unknown.<br><br>

I am hopeful because I am young, like a spark of flame, bringing warmth to those around me.<br><br>

I am hopeful because I am young, like a drop of snowflake, simplistic from afar yet intricate up close.<br><br>

I am hopeful because I am young, like a flash of lightning, confident that I can outrun anything.<br><br>

I am hopeful because I am young, like a sprouting seedling, collecting knowledge from the earth around me.<br><br>

I am hopeful because I am young, like an immovable rock, withstanding the trials of rains and storms.<br><br>

I am hopeful because I am young, like a small stream, flowing across a thousand mountains into the vast ocean.<br><br>

But there will come a day when I am not young, will I still be hopeful then?<br><br>

I do think so, because the memory of my youth will continue to shine like radiating gold, engraved in my memories.<br><br>

So that I will be young again, and hopeful again.

            <h2>Fossil</h2>

            <p>As I gaze into the fossil<br><br>		
First it is a piece of bone<br><br>
And then it is a coffin buried under the ground<br><br>
And then it is suffocating in the deep soil<br><br>
And then it is like the meat between the sandwich<br><br>
And then it becomes a treasure<br><br>
And now it is elevating to surface level<br><br>
And now it is being digged out of the ground<br><br>
And now I am a archaeologist

            <h2>Love That Lady</h2>
            <p>

Love that lady, like a bird loves to fly<br><br>
I said I love that lady, like a bird loves to fly<br><br>
Love to have a conversation with her, love to call her<br><br>
‘My beloved mother!’<br><br><br>

She talk tenderly<br><br>
Smiles like an angel<br><br>
I said she talk tenderly<br><br>
And smiles like an angel<br><br>
Smiles when she is in a good mood<br><br>
When I’m happy, she smiles again<br><br><br>

I like to hug her, like to discuss philosophy with her<br><br>
I said I like to hug her, like to discuss philosophy with her<br><br>
She is wise and smart<br><br>
Giving me all the answers I need<br><br><br>

She spends a lot of time with me, before the rising moon<br><br>
I said she spends a lot of time with me, before the rising moon<br><br>
No matter what happens<br><br>
She will always be my beloved mother
