	   <p>A piece I composed to express my anxiety at the beginning of junior year. One day, I sat down and reflected on my previous hard earned successes, as well as the various challenges I faced as a junior, which included 5 AP classes and establishing my club. However, I also thought about my precious high school experience up to junior year, the people I've met that supported me, as well as my parents who guided me through tough times. Afterwards, I started playing on the piano, attempting to capture these complex emotions. That was how the piece "Recollection" was born, and I consider it one of my best pieces to this day.

            </audio>
		<p>"Tomorrow's Calling" was heavily inspired by the Deltarune soundtrack "A CYBER'S WORLD?", which was 			composed by Toby Fox. It contains a lot of electronic sounds and synthesizers, which gives it a "futuristic" 		vibe to it. The melody and chord progression convey the idea of hopefulness and optimism, as if asking the 		listener to keep moving forward and answer tomorrow's calling.

            </audio>
 <p>This piece was inspired by my love for the Undertale and Deltarune soundtrack. I have always loved how the music in these games enhanced their respective gameplay and storytelling, as well as how well they portray the unique characteristics of the boss fights they play in. I wanted to create something similar, so I created the piece "Final Encouter", focusing on experimenting with different instruments and effects to tell a compelling story.

            </audio>

            <p>"March of the Skeletons" was one of the earliest pieces I've composed. I was playing on my piano and discovered a melody that sounded rather menacing. I added a chord progression to compliment the melody, which took the form of a strong and articulated bassline. I was especially proud of the climax, where I shifted the key and added some high pitched sixteenth notes between the melodies to add "spookiness" to the piece. Upon listening to the finished piece, the first thing that came to mind was, "This really sounds like a theme for a bunch of skeletons marching into battle within a fantasy setting", so "March of the Skeletons" was born.

            </audio>
		<p>"Mischievous Dreams" was a piece that was quite different from my usual approach with compositions. I usually enjoy combining a lot of instruments to make the song feel "grand", but for "Mischievous Dreams", I decided to take a simpler approach and make something lighthearted and "bouncy". The inspiration for the piece came from a series of weird dreams I had, which was why I named the piece "Mischievous Dreams".

            </audio>
	    <p>"Day and Night" was inspired by my perception of day and night as the two different sides of my personality. During daytime, I'm more energetic and outgoing, eager to interact with others. But during night time, I become more reflective and is often immersed in my own thoughts. I tried to capture this idea with "Day and Night", where the first section (day) is groovy and upbeat, and the second section (night) is more dreamy and moody.

            </audio>

            <p>This was the first piece I composed using Fl Studio. It was very much an experiment, since I wasn't used to using professional digital audio workshops, nor was I really experienced with composing. However, I quickly learned the basics of FL Studio through watching youtube tutorials. I downloaded outside sound samples, utilized mixers to alter the sounds, and ultimately created a piece that sounded really good for a first try. Since the song had a very inspirational vibe to it, especially in the climax, I named it "Return from Darkness".

            <p>Rocket Jump Waltz is a track composed by Mike Morasky for the game Team Fortress 2. It is one of my favorite tracks from the game soundtrack, and I liked it so much that I decided to rearrange it in my own style as my first step toward becoming a composer. I added percussion to make the piece sound more like a march, and I also added instruments like accordion and piano to see if they mixed well with the original list of instruments. I was really proud of how my rearrangement turned out, and it continues to serve as an important milestone in my journey as a composer.
